Tabrizi does not have native wifi and lives in a room without access to the ethernet jacks. It has a USB wifi dongle with a random driver compiled from github. This means a few things:

- new kernel release means new driver has to be compiled and installed 
- lots of times wifi doesn't work or has to be manually reconnected
- reformatting means dragging to another room (with a screen and peripherals) to plug into a network to finish netinstaller

== the driver

The driver is located in /tools/rtl

The repository is located at:

The driver is well-documented for installing, uninstalling and downgrading

== connecting to existing wifi

Run `ip a` to confirm the wifi interface is up. If it is down, run:

`sudo ip link set $wlan0 up`

Start wpa_supplicant from the existing config:

`sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i $wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`

At this point run:

`sudo wpa_cli`

This will drop you into an interactive prompt. Use the scan and scan_results to see SSID networks. The standard home networks have already been added as networks 0 and 1 already. Enable one by:

`enable_network 1` (or 0)

then quit to leave the wpa_cli prompt.


=== obtain an ip

After enabling the network, obtain an ip:

`sudo dhclient $wlan0`

Ping something to confirm.


== add new network configuration

Start wpa_supplicant as above.

Launch wpa_cli as above.

Scan networks as above.

Add network using add_network command:

```
>add_network
2
>set_network 2 ssid "MYSSID"
>set_network 2 psk "passphrase"
>enable_network 2
```


== other notes

- I added some env vars that I'm not sure about ($wlan0 and $ssid) that I'm not sure about yet to make interacting with the network interface easier; it is named something really unwieldy by the driver
- did a bad or partially systemd config; maybe needs dhcpd or something configured too
